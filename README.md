# Landing-page
Project: Udacity Frontend Web Developer - Landing Page

<h3>A multi-section landing page with a dynamically updating navigationalmenu.</h3> 

## Description
This project is part of the Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program at Udacity. The goal of this project is to build a landing page that dynamically updates the navigation menu based on the amount of content added to the page. This simulates a real-world scenario where information is pulled from an API and the number of results is unknown until page load.

The landing page is designed to be responsive and usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers. It includes a responsive navigation bar and styling for active states. The active section in the navbar is highlighted as the user scrolls through the page.
